# TASK2
K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history
For this task, I implemented a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchase history, using a dataset from Kaggle. Here’s a brief overview of what I did:



1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized the dataset, preparing it for analysis. 🔍

2. **Optimal Clusters:** Utilized the Elbow Method to determine the ideal number of clusters, ensuring meaningful segmentation. 📉

3. **K-means Clustering:** Applied the K-means algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups, enabling targeted marketing strategies. 🤝

4. **Visualization:** Created insightful visualizations to illustrate the clustering results and analyze customer behavior. 📈



One of the key takeaways from this project was understanding the power of clustering algorithms in uncovering hidden patterns in customer data, which can drive more effective business strategies.🙌
